In this educational project, we demonstrate how to solve DC resistance networks using Python through matrix equations (Circuit_1.py).
The Python calculations are validated through simulations in LTspice.
Additionally, we delve into the discussion of solving overdetermined systems of linear equations (Circuit_2.py).
